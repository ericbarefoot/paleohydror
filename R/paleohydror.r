#' barefoot: A package for holding useful functions for Eric
#'
#' I use this package to hold some functions that are useful to me.
#' 
#' @section barefoot functions:
#' 
#' The functions here make up a mix of tools to calculate and estimate modern suficial processes and back-calculate those processes in ancient rivers. 
#' 
#' \code{settle} calculates the settling velocity of particles following the formulation by Dietrich (1982).
#' 
#' \code{lynds_one} estimates ancient river slope using the first method described by Lynds et al. (2014)
#' 
#' \code{lynds_two} estimates ancient river slope using the second method described by Lynds et al. (2014)
#' 
#' \code{lynds_three} estimates ancient river slope using the third method described by Lynds et al. (2014)
#'
#' \code{xset2H} estimates ancient river dune heights based on cross-set thicknesses. Methods from Leclair and Paola.
#' 
#' \code{H2h} estimates ancient river depths based on dune heights. Methods from Bradley and Venditti.
#' 
#' \code{xset2depthSimple} estimates ancient river depths directly from cross-set thicknesses using the simplest assumptions. Methods from Leclair, Paola, and Bradley and Venditti.
#'
#' \code{azStringConvert} Azimuth conversion for 'quadrant' based strike/trend measurements.
